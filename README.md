# Hey there 👋

I'm Jaziel, a Software Engineer and Full Stack developer based in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, México.

I mostly work with React, Next.js and TypeScript on the frontend, and Node.js, Express or FastAPI on the backend. I enjoy writing clean, scalable code and thinking through architecture — SOLID principles, Clean Code, and patterns that hold up as projects grow.

I'm always learning across the full stack and building things that work in production, not just in theory.
